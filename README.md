# CS-330 Final Project: Brick Breaker Game

## Overview
This project is a brick-breaker-style game created in C++ using OpenGL and GLFW. The objective is to break all destructible bricks using balls that bounce off a paddle. It demonstrates fundamental concepts in game development such as object-oriented programming, real-time graphics rendering, collision detection, and input handling.

## Features
- Paddle movement with left and right arrow keys
- Ball generation with spacebar
- Reflective and destructible brick types
- Score tracking and on-screen display
- "You Win" and "Game Over" end conditions
- Built using Visual Studio with an included `.exe` file for demonstration

## Controls
- **Left Arrow**: Move paddle left
- **Right Arrow**: Move paddle right
- **Spacebar**: Launch a new ball

## Requirements
- Windows OS
- Visual Studio (for building from source)
- OpenGL & GLFW libraries

## How to Run
1. Download and extract the ZIP folder.
2. Run `8-2 Assignment.exe` to play the game.
3. Alternatively, open the Visual Studio project and build from source.
